""" This module contains classes relevant for the intermediate representation (IR) in PyRates. All variations of PyRates
frontends should produce valid instances of IR classes defined in this module and all backends should accept only these
instances as input. Thus the intermediate representation is assumed to be consistent across different frontends and
backends.
