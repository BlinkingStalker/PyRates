================

The examples provided in this section will instruct you:

* how to create YAML templates for operators, nodes, edges and circuits in PyRates,
* how to handle the template classes of the PyRates frontend,
* how to build network graphs from those template classes via the intermediate representations,
* how to load a network graph into the backend to perform subsequent simulations.

To interactively learn how to perform these different steps, please have a look at the jupyter notebook `Tutorial_PyRates_Basics.ipynb` available at our github repository (https://github.com/pyrates-neuroscience/PyRates/tree/master/documentation). To run this jupyter notebook, simply activate the python environment that contains your PyRates installation, directory in which you saved the notebook and enter the following line into your command terminal::
