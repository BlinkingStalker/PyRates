    "# Neural Population Models\n",

    "## What are neural population models?\n",
    "\n",
    "They are biophysically motivated non-linear models of neural dynamics that describe the average activity of large cell populations in the brain based on mean-field assumptions (freeman_models_1978,lopes_da_silva_model_1974,jansen_electroencephalogram_1995). Often, they express the state of each neural population by an average membrane potential and an average firing rate. The dynamics and transformations of these state variables can typically be formulated via three mathematical operators. The first two describe the input-output structure of a single population: While the rate-to-potential operator (RPO) transforms synaptic inputs into average membrane potential changes, the potential-to-rate operator (PRO) transforms the average membrane potential into an average firing rate output. Widely used forms for these operators are a convolution operation with an alpha kernel for the RPO (e.g. jansen_electroencephalogram_1995,david_neural_2003,cona_neural_2011) and a sigmoidal, instantaneous transformation for the PRO (e.g. lopes_da_silva_model_1974,moran_neural_2007,wang_realistic_2013). The third operator is the coupling operator (CO) that transforms outgoing into incoming firing rates and is thus used to establish connections across populations. By describing the dynamics of large neural population networks via three basic transforms (RPO, PRO & CO), neural populations combine computational feasibility with biophysical interpretability. Due to these desirable qualities, they have become an attractive method for studying neural dynamics on a meso- and macroscopic scale (deco_dynamic_2008,coombes_large-scale_2010,breakspear_dynamic_2017). They have been established as one of the most popular methods for modeling EEG/MEG and fMRI measurements and were able to account for various dynamic properties of experimentally observed neural activity (david_dynamic_2006,babajani_integrated_2006,sotero_realistically_2007,bojak_connecting_2010,cona_neural_2011,spiegler_modeling_2011,onslow_canonical_2014,kunze_transcranial_2016).\n",

    "## Why are neural population models useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Investigating the human brain via EEG/MEG or fMRI means working with signals that are assumed to represent changes in the average activity of large cell populations. While these signals could in theory be explained by detailed models of single cell processes, such models come with a state space of much higher dimensionality than the measured signals and would thus need to be reduced again for comparison. Additionally, the interpretability of single cell activities would be limited, since an average signal is modelled that could result from endlessly many different single cell activation patterns. As an alternative, neural population models (also called neural mass models) have widely been used (Coombes, 2010). They allow for a more direct comparison to EEG/MEG and fMRI signals, since changes in the average activity across many cells are thought to generate those signals (david_neural_2003,babajani_integrated_2006).\n",

    "## Classical neural mass models: The Jansen-Rit model\n",
    "\n",
    "A particular neural population model we will use repeatedly in later sections is the three-population circuit introduced by Jansen and Rit (jansen_electroencephalogram_1995). The Jansen-Rit circuit (JRC) was originally proposed as a mechanistic model of the EEG signal generated by the visual cortex (jansen_neurophysiologically-based_1993,jansen_electroencephalogram_1995). Historically, however, it has been used as a canonical model of cell population interactions in a cortical column (david_dynamic_2006,sotero_realistically_2007,kunze_transcranial_2016). Its basic structure can be seen in Figure XY, which can be thought of as a zoom-in on a single cortical column. The signal generated by this column is the result of the dynamic interactions between a projection cell population (PC), an excitatory interneuron population (EIN) and an inhibitory interneuron population (IIN). For certain parametrizations, the JRC has been shown to be able to produce key features of a typical EEG signal, such as the waxing-and-waning alpha oscillations (jansen_electroencephalogram_1995,david_neural_2003,spiegler_bifurcation_2010). A detailed account of the model's mathematical description will be given in the next section, where we will demonstrate how to implement models in PyRates, using the example of the JRC equations. We chose to employ the JRC as an exemplary population model in this article, since it is an established model used in numerous publications the reader can compare our reports against.\n",

    "## Accurate mean-field models: The Montbrio model\n",
    "\n",
    "Another neural population model that we will make use of in this paper is the one described by Montbrio and colleagues (montbrio_macroscopic_2015). It has been mentioned as one of the next generation neural mass models that provide a more precise mean-field description than classic neural population models like the JRC (coombes_next_2019). The model proposed by Montbrio and colleagues represents a mathematically exact mean-field derivation of a network of globally coupled quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons (montbrio_macroscopic_2015). It can thus represent every macroscopic state the single cell network may fall into. This distinguishes it from the JRC, since it has no such correspondence between a single cell network and the population descriptions. Furthermore, the macroscopic states (average membrane potential and average firing rate) of the Montbri\\'o model can be linked directly to the synchronicity of the underlying single-cell network, a property which benefits the investigation of EEG phenomena such as event-related (de-)synchronization. We chose this model as our second example case due to its novelty and its potential importance for future neural population studies. Within the domain of rate-based neural population models, we found these two models sufficiently distinct to demonstrate the ability of PyRates to implement different model structures. \n",
